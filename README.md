# TrueNews

True News solves partially distorted news for online consumers by providing supplementary information to users to enable them to form unbiased perspectives. As news organizations are increasingly becoming more polarized, biased news has increased exponentially. We learned that while over 300 million Americans consume news online, 66% of Americans believe that the media is biased. To solve the problem of unknown media bias, our product provides supplementary data for users to allow them to understand all perspectives of any topic and to make informed opinions.

This project was undertaken by Peru Dayani, Ashvin Nihalani, Diana Chavez, Elaine Kim and Joyce Li in Industrial Engineering 186: Product Management.
